#### Built using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery

#### This version of Connect Four is a visually reimagined version of the classic game with thought focused on visuals/animations after functionality was achieved. The game is the well-known red chip versus black chip and whichever color first gets four of their chips in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game. The board can be reset by clicking "play again" at the bottom of the board.  

#### On page load, the size-in and spin CSS animations where timed to lead from the heading title of the game ("Let's Play Connect Four!") to cease spinning first to initially draw focus there, followed by the board, then finally the player that goes first.Although the size-in and spin animations are completed quickly on page load, the order of their completion, I believe, lends to a sense of excitement. When a player is ready to place their chip, the color changing chip hover effects makes the player's intended placement area spin and change color in a "ghostly" fashion to keep the user visually engaged while not taking away from the basic well-known functionality of the classic game so as not to confuse the player. Finally, when the chip is chosen, there is a quick spin of their color chip and on the second page heading the next player's turn is indicated.

#### My main goal for this game was to create a visually-appealing and modern version that did not take away from the classic concept and spirit of Connect Four.
